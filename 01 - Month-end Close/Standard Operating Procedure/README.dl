## The Close Operating Model
The framework typically includes:

- Locked master template  
- Controlled working files  
- Assumption tracking  
- Documented evidence locations  
- Defined approval workflow

## Status & Risk Philosophy
Tasks progress through formal statuses and must not advance without meeting control requirements.

RAG indicators provide management with immediate visibility of execution risk.

---

## Post-Close Discipline
Adjustments after close are **exceptional**, require approval, and must maintain a full audit trail.

---

## Evidence Requirements
Every task must demonstrate:

- Source of data  
- Calculation or reconciliation  
- Journal linkage (if applicable)  
- Reviewer evidence  
- Completion date  

If it cannot be evidenced → it is not complete.

## Typical Close Duration
The standard close cycle is approximately **10 working days**, subject to business complexity.
